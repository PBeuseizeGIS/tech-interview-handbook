Hash Table
==

- Describe an implementation of a least-used cache, and big-O notation of it.
- A question involving an API's integration with hash map where the buckets of hash map are made up of linked lists.
- Implement data structure `Map` storing pairs of integers (key, value) and define following member functions in O(1) runtime: `void insert(key, value)`, `void delete(key)`, `int get(key)`, `int getRandomKey()`.

Interview Questions on Hashing Techniques

1.Longest Consecutive Subsequence...

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Examples--

Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2}; Output: 4 The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements

Input: arr[] = {36, 41, 56, 35, 44, 33, 34, 92, 43, 32, 42} Output: 5 The subsequence 36, 35, 33, 34, 32 is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements.
